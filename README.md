# Introduction

I recently saw this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You joined twitter. <br> ↓ <br>You didn’t understand.<br> ↓ <br>Forgot about it for years.<br> ↓ <br>Came back randomly one day.<br> ↓ <br>You got addicted.</p>&mdash; ᙀᙏᗩYYᗩ😌 (@neshagram) <a href="https://twitter.com/neshagram/status/1348245094097252355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I started using Twitter in 2009 when I was 13 years old. Do you know what I remember from 2009? Absolutely nothing. I was just finishing up elementary school and didn't know any of the implications about using this website with a cute blue bird on it ![Twitter Logo 2009](Twitter-Logo-2009.jpg). High school passes, University passes, and now I'm working and dawns on me that may have tweeted some wildly stupid stuff back with I was 13 years old. I better go back and delete some inappropriate things I may or may not have said before someone cancels me for it.

The purpose of this project is to read local Twitter data and display it to the user.
